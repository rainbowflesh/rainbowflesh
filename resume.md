## Employee History

Im an entrepreneur and adviser running a group companies engage in engineering, procurement, construction; yet, Im an computer fan and most of "employee history" is making interesting products with my colleagues; check out my recently works, a target tracking device [zeewind-uav.com](zeewind-uav.com)

Yet, I still have an intern experience in PowerChina KHID, just GIS/BIM web fullstack R&D with java and vue, interesting experience but boring tech stack.
